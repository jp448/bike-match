# bike-match
Bike Match is a airbnb rental market place, but for bike rentals.

**Introduction**

This app was created in one week during the Le Wagon bootcamp. It is built with Ruby on Rails using a postgres database. The frontend uses the bootstrap framework and Sass. It was created in a team with 3 other Le Wagon Students as a practice app before the final project. It is structured similar to an airbnb rental market but the users can rent bikes rather than flats.

**App Description**

Users can use Bike Match to find quality bike rentals in their area. If users are only in the area for vacation they can easily find rentals in different categories depending on their needs (moutain bike, racing bike, city bike etc). Users can also post a bike for rental themselves so that during the week when their bike is not being used it can be rented out. Users can peruse the website to see if any of the options are a good fit. After finding a bike they would like to rent they can either sign in or sign up to the platform. They then can book the bike and see their bookings on their personal dashboard. They can use the dashboard to edit or delete any current bookings they have. They can also post their personal bike on the website for rent. 

**App Improvements**

If I had more time here are the improvements I would make to the app: 
* Make the design responsive
* account for avaliblity when doing bookings
* add unit tests
* make user photo dynamic
* improve search bar
